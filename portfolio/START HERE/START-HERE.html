      <p>
        Growing up, I never would have thought that I would become a software
        engineer. I was always more interested in sports and spending time
        outdoors than sitting in front of a computer. But as I got older and
        started to explore the world of technology, I realized that it was
        something that I was actually really passionate about. It wasn't always
        easy - there were times when I struggled to understand concepts or get
        my code to work. But I persevered and eventually found myself on a path
        towards a career in software engineering. Looking back, I'm so glad that
        I took that first step and pursued my interests in technology. It's been
        an exciting and rewarding journey, and I can't wait to see what the
        future holds.

      <p>
        My name is Ignas Apšega and I hail from a small city in Lithuania. At
        present, I am studying ICT & Software Engineering at a university in
        Eindhoven. Since the beginning of the cryptocurrency boom in 2020, I
        have been deeply interested in the potential of blockchain technology to
        address a wide range of global issues related to banking, privacy,
        security, and more. This curiosity about blockchain led me to explore
        the world of cryptocurrency and to learn about decentralized apps
        (dApps) and smart contracts. I am excited about the opportunity to
        participate in this graduation internship because it will allow me to
        apply my skills as a front-end developer and to leverage my knowledge of
        cyber security, which I have studied for two semesters.

            system operates at both the macro and micro levels. In my leisure
            time, I engage in music production as a way to stimulate the
            creative side of my brain. I am also an avid fitness enthusiast and

      <h3 class="w3-center">CONTEXT</h3>
      <p class="w3-content">
        As part of my graduation internship, I had the opportunity to work on a
        project focused on blockchain technology and the privacy concerns of DAO
        users. DAOs are decentralized organizations that operate using smart
        contracts on a blockchain, and one of the key challenges in this space
        is ensuring that user privacy is protected. My internship involved
        researching and proposing solutions to address these privacy issues,
        with a focus on finding ways to balance the need for transparency and
        accountability within DAOs with the need to protect sensitive user data.
        It was a challenging and rewarding experience that allowed me to delve
        deeply into the technical and societal implications of blockchain
        technology and DAOs
      </p>
      <!-- Sub head 1 -->
      <div id="context" class="pt-20">
        <h3 class="w3-center">PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p class="w3-content">
          Tooling for DAOs is in active development and new improvements and
          solutions are introduced regularly. One of the main DAO features is
          that they want to be completely transparent, but DAO members may want
          to stay anonymous and still be a part of this organization. DAOs use
          smart contracts to work in a blockchain. These smart contracts are
          made of chunks of code that help execute operations automatically when
          a set of criteria are met. While Ethereum was the first blockchain to
          use smart contracts, it is deployed on various other blockchains. Many
          blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning anyone with
          an Internet connection can view a list of the network's transaction
          history. This leads to the issue of low privacy because users of DAOs
          may not want their activities such as voting or proposing to be
          displayed to everyone on the network. Currently, Byont has not enough
          resources to look into possible solutions. However, they still want to
          conduct research and do some possible development of this technology
          for their projects.

        <h3 class="w3-center">THE GOALS</h3>
        <p class="w3-content">
          The main goals of my graduation internship were to research and
          develop solutions for improving privacy for users within DAOs. This
          involved identifying the key privacy challenges faced by DAO users,
          researching available tooling and technologies that could be used to
          address these challenges, and designing and prototyping potential
          solutions. As part of the internship, I also worked to provide advice
          and guidance on the best approaches for addressing privacy concerns
          within the context of DAOs. Overall, the goal of the internship was to
          advise and show Byont the possible tooling and solutions for solving
          privacy issues of the users within DAOs.

        <h3 class="w3-center">SOLUTION</h3>
        <p class="w3-content">
          The final products of this internship will be research documents,
          blogs, and advice on the possible solutions for improving user privacy
          in DAOs, with a focus on conducting research and development on
          technologies and approaches that can improve privacy. This may involve
          writing research documents and blogs to explore the various options
          available, as well as providing advice and guidance on the best
          approaches for addressing privacy concerns. In addition to this, proof
          of concept and prototypes will be submitted to Byont, with the goal of
          engaging in prototyping and testing of possible technologies and
          solutions to see how they perform in practice. If possible, prototype
          implementation for current projects of Byont should be carried out as
          well. By doing this, Byont can help to advance the state of the art in
          this area and contribute to the development of better tooling and
          approaches for ensuring privacy within DAOs.

        The project management followed a mix of Agile methodologies, with a
        focus on the Scrum methodology. I conducted weekly stand-ups and made
        sprint deliveries to update my mentor on my progress so far. Each week
        on Monday, I had Sprint planning and Sprint review meetings. In
        addition, each sprint was one week long. Additionally, I created a
        project plan that consisted of initiation, research and methodology,
        execution and closure phases.

      <p>
        The graduation internship project started off very well, with everything
        going according to plan and meeting the initial goals. However, as time
        passed and the complexity and scope of the project grew, it became
        increasingly difficult to follow the project plan and maintain focus on
        the initial goals. One of the main challenges I faced was the technology
        I was working with, which was very new and involved an academic level of
        mathematical knowledge and cryptography that I did not have. This made
        it difficult to fully understand the technical aspects of the project,
        and it also impacted the planning process as I struggled to grasp the
        concepts and techniques being used.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to this, the research phase of the project took longer than
        expected, as I had to spend extra time learning about the technology and
        trying to get up to speed. Despite my best efforts, I am not entirely
        proud of the results of the project, and I feel that more could have
        been done to add value for the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these challenges, I am proud of this internship for a number of
        reasons. One of the biggest risks I took was working with new, emerging
        technologies, which can be both exciting and challenging. I learned a
        lot about the professional skills required to be successful in the ICT
        domain, and I gained valuable experience working on a real-world
        project.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most important things I learned as an ICT professional is the
        importance of gathering user requirements from stakeholders which I wish
        I did more properly. This is crucial in order to ensure that the project
        is meeting the needs of the users and delivering value. I learned the
        importance of asking the right questions and listening carefully to the
        responses, as well as being proactive in seeking out feedback and input
        from stakeholders. Communication with stakeholders is also key, as it
        helps to keep everyone on the same page and ensure that the project is
        moving in the right direction. This was a big learning point for me
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important lesson I learned is the importance of timing. As an
        ICT professional, it is essential to be able to accurately measure the
        time needed to solve a problem or implement a particular solution. This
        helps to ensure that projects stay on track and are completed within the
        allocated time and resources. I learned the value of creating detailed
        project plans and schedules, and the importance of regularly reviewing
        and updating these plans to account for changing circumstances and
        priorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the technical and professional skills I gained during
        this internship, I also learned a lot about myself and how I work best.
        I discovered that I enjoy being challenged and pushed out of my comfort
        zone. I also learned that I am more resilient and capable than I had
        previously thought, and that I can handle difficult situations and
        setbacks with grace and determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this internship has been a valuable learning experience for me,
        and I am grateful for the opportunity to work on such a challenging and
        rewarding project. While there were certainly some difficulties and
        setbacks along the way, I believe that I have grown both professionally
        and personally as a result of this experience. I have gained new skills,
        knowledge, and confidence, and I am excited to apply these lessons as I
        move forward in my career.
